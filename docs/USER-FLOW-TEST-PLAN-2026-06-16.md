# Real-User-Flow & Scenario Test Plan

**Project**: kendo-translation platform
**Date**: 2026-06-16
**Phase**: Design / planning — downstream instrumented Playwright implementation will follow
**Author**: aki-research

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines a **comprehensive real-user-flow test plan** for the kendo-translation platform. Unlike the existing 30+ isolated specs (unit, API, component, and the 16-test `production-smoke.spec.ts`), these flows simulate **end-to-end user journeys** across multiple pages, roles, and UI states. Each flow measures both **correctness** (did it work?) and **UX quality** (was it fast? readable? free of layout shift?).

### 1.1 What this plan covers

- Navigational flows spanning multiple pages and role transitions.
- Per-step **timing instrumentation points** for latency measurement.
- **Readability/accessibility checkpoints** (contrast, font legibility, skeleton states, layout shift).
- Cross-cutting scenarios: theme × page, language EN/ZH, viewport, cold vs. warm starts, small vs. large documents.

### 1.2 What this plan does NOT cover

- **Isolated unit tests** (e.g., segment CRUD, filter logic, badge counts) — already covered.
- **Pure API tests** (e.g., `POST /api/mac-rag/compose`, `GET /api/terminology`) — already covered in 16 @smoke tests.
- **The actual `.spec.ts` files** — this is the design deliverable; instrumented Playwright tests are a downstream phase.
- **Code coverage metrics** or fuzz testing.

### 1.3 Relationship to existing test suite

| Existing suite | Coverage type | This plan adds |
|---|---|---|
| `production-smoke.spec.ts` (16 tests) | Single-page existence + basic API health | Multi-step user journeys |
| `editor.spec.ts`, `reader.spec.ts`, etc. | Isolated page-level interactions | Cross-page flows (edit → advance → reader verify) |
| `suggestions-api.spec.ts`, `agents-api.spec.ts`, etc. | API contract testing | UI-driven acceptance/rejection with modal interaction |
| `reader-screenshots.spec.ts` | Single-theme snapshots | Multi-theme cross-page contrast audit |

## 2. Personas

| Persona | Roles | Goals |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | `admin` (admin-1@test.com / test-password) | Manage documents, users, assignments, publish policies, monitor dashboard |
| **Translator** | `translator` (translator-1@test.com / test-password) | Edit assigned segments, advance phases, request agent suggestions, resolve QA issues |
| **Reader** | `reader` (reader-1@test.com / test-password) | Browse, read, search, bookmark documents; switch themes and languages |
| **Anonymous / First-time Visitor** | Unauthenticated | Land on homepage, register, log in |

## 3. Flow Catalogue

### 3.1 Reader Persona

#### RF-READER-01 — Browse → open book → read bilingual → bookmark → resume

**Entry point**: `/documents` (authenticated as reader-1)
**Preconditions**: Reader is logged in. Document list loaded (default 31 docs).

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Navigate to `/documents` | — | Page renders with document grid | `navigationStart` → `domcontentloaded` → first `DocumentCard` visible |
| 2 | Sort by "Least translated" | `[data-testid="documents-sort"]` → change to `progress_asc` | List reorders; least-translated docs appear first | Action click → list re-render complete |
| 3 | Click first document card | First `a[href*="/documents/"][href*="/read"]` | Navigate to `/documents/[id]/read` | Navigation timing |
| 4 | Wait for reader content-visible | Reader `main` region has rendered segments (no skeleton) | Bilingual view visible with segments | `domcontentloaded` → first segment text visible |
| 5 | Switch to BilingualParagraphView | View-mode button with text "Bilingual (paragraph)" | Segments render in paragraph format with EN+ZH pairs (if ZH present) | Click → view re-render |
| 6 | Add a bookmark | Bookmark button (star/bookmark icon) | Bookmark appears in bookmarks panel; count increments | Click → UI response |
| 7 | Navigate to page 3 | Pagination control: "Next" or page number | Page advances; URL updates; segments for new page render | Click → new page segments visible |
| 8 | Add second bookmark | Same as step 6 | Second bookmark stored | Click → UI response |
| 9 | Navigate to `/documents` | Click "Docs" in breadcrumb or nav | Back to document list | Navigation timing |
| 10 | Return to same document via recently-viewed sort | `[data-testid="documents-sort"]` → "Recently Viewed" | Document appears first | Click → sort re-render |
| 11 | Open document → confirm resumed at bookmarked page | Click document card | Reader opens near bookmarked page; reading progress restored | Page load → bookmarked position visible |

**Success signal**: All 11 steps complete without error. Bookmark count increments correctly. Reading position persists across re-visit.

**UX / readability checkpoints**:
- Step 4: Verify no gray-on-white text below WCAG AA 4.5:1 contrast ratio on default reader theme (light).
- Step 4: Check that skeleton/loading state transitions cleanly to content (no flash of empty).
- Step 5: Verify bilingual layout doesn't overflow viewport on 1280×800.
- Step 11: Verify no cumulative layout shift (CLS) during reading-progress restoration.

| 2 | Switch theme to "Dark" | Theme button labeled "Dark" | Background turns dark; text turns light | Click → `document.documentElement` class change |
| 3 | Capture screenshot for contrast audit | — | Dark theme applied; all text readable | Post theme transition |
| 4 | Repeat for each of the remaining 5 themes: solarized, pastel, sepia, high-contrast, night-warm | Respective theme buttons | Each theme applies correctly | Per theme |
| 5 | Switch theme to "High Contrast" | "High Contrast" button | High-contrast colors applied; text crisp | Click → transition |
| 6 | Verify font color picker works on high-contrast | Font color input/picker | Custom color applied to reader text | Color change → re-render |
| 7 | Change font to "Mincho" | Font selector → "Mincho" | Serif CJK font applied to reader text | Font change → re-render |
| 8 | Increase font size to 24px | "+" button (aria-label="Increase font size") | Text size increases | Each increment |
| 9 | Decrease font size to 12px | "−" button (aria-label="Decrease font size") | Text size decreases | Each decrement |
| 10 | Switch layout to "Two Column" | `[data-testid="layout-width-control"]` → "Two Column" button | Layout switches to two-column | Click → layout reflow |
| 11 | Switch layout to "Narrow" | "Narrow" button | Layout constrains to narrow width | Click → layout reflow |

**Success signal**: All 7 themes apply without visual glitches. Font size changes between 10–32px work. Layout width toggles reflow correctly.

**UX / readability checkpoints**:
- For each of the 7 themes, compute contrast ratio between body text color and background using WCAG AA 4.5:1 threshold. Flag any theme that fails.
- Verify gray-on-white issue (previously `text-gray-600` → `text-gray-800` fix) is not regressed on light theme.
- Verify font color picker does not produce unreadable combos (e.g., white text on white background).

- Step 2: Verify editor does NOT show the mobile phone-block banner on desktop viewport (≥768px).
- Step 6: Verify save feedback (toast, inline confirmation) is visible and non-blocking.

**Timing measurement**:
- **Login-to-editor latency**: step 1 `navigationStart` → step 3 content-visible.
- **Segment activation latency**: click segment row → `SegmentEditorPanel` visible.
- **Save RTT**: Ctrl+S → API response → UI confirmation.
- **Phase advance RTT**: confirm click → API response → badge + history update.

| 2 | Request agent suggestion | `[data-testid="agent-suggestion-trigger"]` | Loading state; agent generates suggestion | Click → loading → suggestion appears |
| 3 | Verify suggestion card renders | `[data-testid="suggestion-row"]` | Suggestion visible with accept/reject buttons | Suggestion loaded |
| 4 | Accept suggestion | `[data-testid="suggestion-accept"]` | **EditPatternModal** opens (since segment is in `translated` phase — wait: for draft→translated the phase of the segment matters; if segment is draft, accepting a translate-phase suggestion writes to target_text directly). If segment is translated, EditPatternModal opens. | Click → modal visible |
| 5 | Interact with modal (if opened) | Modal content | Confirm or cancel edit-pattern application | Modal interaction |
| 6 | Verify segment target_text updated | Segment target_text display | Text reflects accepted suggestion | Content updated |

**Success signal**: Agent suggestion generated and accepted. Segment text updated. No error toasts.

**UX / readability checkpoints**:
- Step 2: Agent loading state should be clear (spinner, skeleton, or progress indicator — not a frozen UI).
- Step 4: Modal should not trap focus incorrectly; ESC should close it.
- Step 3: Suggestion card text contrast against background.

#### RF-ANON-02 — 401 gate verification

**Entry point**: `/api/documents` (unauthenticated)
**Preconditions**: No auth session.

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Attempt direct API access | `GET /api/documents` | Returns 401 | API response |

### 3.5 Cross-Cutting Flows

#### RF-CROSS-01 — Cold-start latency measurement

**Entry point**: Any page (production Vercel, after ~5 min idle).
**Preconditions**: Fresh browser context; no cached session.

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Request `/login` (unauthenticated, no DB) | — | Page renders | `navigationStart` → `domcontentloaded` → paint |
| 2 | Request `/documents` (authenticated, cold Supabase) | — | Page renders with document list | `navigationStart` → SSR complete → hydration → content visible |
| 3 | Request `/admin` (authenticated, cold analytics API) | — | Page renders; stat cards eventually hydrate | `navigationStart` → stat card numbers visible |
| 4 | Request `/documents/[id]/read` (small doc, cold) | — | Reader renders with segments | `navigationStart` → first segment visible |

**Method**: 3-attempt retry pattern from `production-smoke.spec.ts` (3 attempts, 2s delay between each).

**Success signal**: All pages render within timeout (60s per attempt). Document per-step timing for baseline.

---

#### RF-CROSS-02 — Large-book performance: 23,500-segment document

**Entry point**: `/documents/[id]/edit` for a large document (e.g., Kendojidai 2014, ~23,529 segments).
**Preconditions**: Admin logged in.

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Navigate to large doc editor | Direct URL | Editor loads with first page of segments | `navigationStart` → segment list visible |
| 2 | Measure segment list render time | First `[data-testid="segment-list-item"]` visible | Within acceptable bounds | Time to first segment visible |
| 3 | Scroll through segment list | Scroll down | Virtualization or pagination works; no browser hang | Scroll responsiveness |
| 4 | Apply filter (e.g., "draft" only) | Status filter | Filter applies; filtered count shown | Click → re-filter time |
| 5 | Select and edit a segment | Click segment → edit | Editor panel opens responsively | Click → editor visible |
| 6 | Navigate reader for same doc | `/documents/[id]/read` | Reader renders with pagination | Navigation → first page visible |

**Success signal**: Large doc does not crash or hang the browser. Filter/search remain responsive.

**Timing**:
- **Editor initial load**: `navigationStart` → first segment list item visible. Warning if > 15s warm.
- **Filter response**: < 2s for client-side filter on 23,500 items.
- **Reader pagination**: page-to-page navigation < 3s.

**UX / readability checkpoints**:
- Verify no memory leaks (browser tab memory growth across 10 page navigations).

---

#### RF-CROSS-03 — Global theme persistence across pages (SiteNav gear)

**Entry point**: Any page where SiteNav is visible (NOT reader/editor/`/`/login/register).
**Preconditions**: User logged in.

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | On `/documents`, click gear icon | `[data-testid="global-theme-trigger"]` in SiteNav | Theme settings panel opens | Click → panel visible |
| 2 | Switch to dark mode | Dark mode toggle | SiteNav + page switch to dark colors | Click → theme change |
| 3 | Navigate to `/search` | Search nav link | Search page renders in dark mode | Navigation → theme persists |
| 4 | Navigate to `/terminology` | Terminology nav link | Terminology page renders in dark mode | Navigation → theme persists |
| 5 | Navigate to `/profile` | Profile nav link | Profile page renders in dark mode | Navigation → theme persists |
| 6 | Navigate to `/documents/[id]/read` | Reader | **Known caveat**: SiteNav is hidden on reader. Reader has its own 7 themes. The global theme setting may or may not affect the reader's initial theme (verify behavior). | Navigation → reader initial theme |

**Success signal**: Global theme persists across pages where SiteNav is visible.

**UX / readability checkpoints**:
- Step 2–5: Verify all text remains readable in dark mode (no dark text on dark background).
- Step 6: Document the interaction between global theme and reader-specific theme.

---

#### RF-CROSS-04 — Error / empty states

**Entry point**: Various.
**Preconditions**: Varies.

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Visit `/documents` with no documents | `/documents` as reader with no docs | Empty state message (not crash) | Page load |
| 2 | Visit editor for non-existent doc ID | `/documents/nonexistent-id/edit` | Error state rendered (not blank page) | Page load |
| 3 | Visit reader for doc with 0 segments | `/documents/[unsegmented-id]/read` | "No segments" or empty state | Page load |
| 4 | Search for term with 0 results | Search sidebar → type gibberish | "No results" message | Typing → result |
| 5 | Attempt phase advance on locked/conflicting segment | Editor → advance | `[data-testid="phase-advance-stale"]` or error message | Click → error response |

**Success signal**: All error/empty states render user-friendly messages, not blank pages or raw stack traces.

---

#### RF-CROSS-05 — EN/ZH language switcher consistency

**Entry point**: Editor and reader, all documents.
**Preconditions**: User logged in.

| Step | Action | Selector / data-testid | Expected outcome | Timing point |
|------|--------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Editor: switch to ZH | `[data-testid="lang-tab-zh"]` | Segment source_text shows Japanese, target_text shows ZH | Click → segments reload |
| 2 | Editor: verify ZH segment count matches EN count | Segment list length | Same number of segments (all docs have both lang variants) | Data comparison |
| 3 | Reader: switch to ZH | `button:has-text("中文")` | Reader shows ZH content | Click → content re-render |
| 4 | Switch back to EN in both | EN toggle | EN content restored | Click → content re-render |

## 4. Cross-Cutting Scenario Matrix

### 4.1 Themes × Pages (contrast audit)

| Theme | `/documents` | `/admin` | Reader (light bg) | Reader (dark bg) | `/search` | `/terminology` | `/profile` |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Light** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (reader theme) | N/A | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Dark** | ✓ (SiteNav) | ✓ | Reader theme: dark | ✓ (reader theme) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Solarized** | N/A | N/A | ✓ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Pastel** | N/A | N/A | ✓ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Sepia** | N/A | N/A | ✓ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **High Contrast** | N/A | N/A | ✓ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Night Warm** | N/A | N/A | N/A | ✓ | N/A | N/A | N/A |

For each ✓ cell, run automated contrast check (computed style luminance ratio vs. WCAG AA 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text).

Priority targets: light-theme `/admin` (gray-on-white risk), high-contrast reader theme (should obviously pass), dark-theme admin (dark text on dark bg risk).

### 4.2 Language EN/ZH

| Page | EN | ZH |
|------|----|----|
| Reader (SingleLanguageView) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reader (BilingualParagraphView) | ✓ (EN + ZH side-by-side) |
| Editor segment list (source/target) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/search` results | ✓ | ✓ (ZH segments in results) |

### 4.3 Viewport

| Viewport | Desktop (1280×800) | Tablet (768×1024) | Mobile (375×812) |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `/` landing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/documents` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reader | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Editor | ✓ | ✓ | **BLOCKED** (phone-block banner) |
| `/admin` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (may have horizontal scroll) |
| `/search` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/terminology` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/profile` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### 4.4 Cold vs. Warm

| Page | Warm (< 5 min idle) | Cold (> 5 min idle, Vercel Hobby) |
|------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/login` | Fast (< 2s) | Slower (3–8s) |
| `/documents` | Fast (SSR cached) | Slower (cold Supabase + Next.js) |
| `/admin` | Fast (< 5s) | **Very slow** (analytics API: 5 parallel COUNT queries over ~396k segments; allow 60s) |
| Reader | Fast (< 3s) | Slower (5–15s) |
| Editor (small doc) | Fast (< 3s) | Slower (5–15s) |
| Editor (large doc) | Medium (5–15s) | Very slow (15–60s+) |

### 4.5 Small vs. Large Document

| Flow | Small doc ("Kendo Philosophy", 3 segs) | Large doc (Kendojidai 2014, ~23,529 segs) |
|------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Editor initial load | < 2s warm | < 15s warm |
| Reader page turn | Instant | < 3s |
| Filter in editor | Instant (client-side, 3 items) | < 2s (client-side, 23k items) |
| Search in reader sidebar | Fast (3 pages) | Moderate (many pages) |

---

## 5. Measurement Methodology

All flows in Section 3 will be instrumented in a downstream Playwright implementation as follows.

### 5.1 Per-step timing

| Measurement | Technique | API / tool |
|---|---|---|
| **Navigation time** | `performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0]` via `page.evaluate` after `domcontentloaded` | Performance API: `domContentLoadedEventEnd - navigationStart`, `loadEventEnd - navigationStart` |
| **Content-visible time** | `page.waitForSelector` with a content-specific selector + `Date.now()` delta from nav start | Playwright `waitForSelector` + manual `Date.now()` |
| **Action→response time** | `Date.now()` before action (click/fill/keypress) and after expected UI response element is visible | `test.step` wrapper with `performance.now()` bookends |
| **Hydration-to-content** | Delta between `domcontentloaded` and first non-skeleton content element visible | Two `Date.now()` snapshots |
| **API RTT** | Wait for network response (`page.waitForResponse`) + UI update delta | Playwright network interception + content wait |
| **Cold-start retry** | 3-attempt pattern from `production-smoke.spec.ts`: retry with 2s backoff | `for` loop in `beforeAll` / per-test |

**Key principle**: Use `domcontentloaded`, NOT `networkidle`. Realtime WebSocket subscriptions (Supabase Realtime for presence, activity badges) mean `networkidle` never settles. All content-visible waits must target specific DOM elements (testids, text content, role selectors), not generic load states.

### 5.2 UX / readability capture

| Concern | Technique |
|---|---|
| **Contrast ratio** | After content-visible, call `page.evaluate` to read `getComputedStyle(el).color` and `getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor`; compute relative luminance per WCAG 2.1 formula; assert ≥ 4.5:1 for body text, ≥ 3:1 for large text (≥18px or ≥14px bold). Optionally integrate `@axe-core/playwright` for automated a11y scans. |
| **Gray-on-white detection** | Specific check: if `color` is a gray hex (`#6b7280`, `#9ca3af`, etc.) and background is white/near-white, flag as potential issue even if mathematically passing (subjective readability). |
| **Skeleton vs. real content** | Screenshot at `domcontentloaded` (skeleton) and after content-visible (real content). Compare; if identical, content never loaded. Flag if skeleton visible for > 3s without progress indicator. |
| **Layout shift (CLS)** | Use `page.evaluate` to read `performance.getEntriesByType('layout-shift')` (where supported) or snapshot-based visual diff: two screenshots 500ms apart after content-visible; compute pixel diff area. |
| **Screenshot capture** | Full-page or viewport-only screenshots at key moments: (a) skeleton/loading state, (b) content-visible, (c) post-interaction. Saved to `test-results/user-flow-screenshots/[flow-id]/[step]-[label].png`. |
| **Mobile-specific** | Viewport 375×812; check for horizontal overflow, touch target size (≥44px), font legibility at mobile scale. |

### 5.3 Cookie-injected auth for efficiency

Replicate `production-smoke.spec.ts` `injectSession` pattern: log in via Supabase REST API `POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=password` in `beforeAll`, set `sb-<ref>-auth-token` cookies on the `BrowserContext`. This avoids per-flow form-login overhead and is faster than browser-based login.

### 5.4 Document selection strategy

- **Quick flows** (RF-READER theme switch, RF-TRANS edit cycle): Use smallest segmented doc ("Kendo Philosophy", 3 segments).
- **Realistic flows** (RF-READER browse + search, RF-TRANS full TEP): Use a medium doc (100–500 segments, identified at test runtime from `/api/documents`).
- **Large-book flows** (RF-CROSS-02): Use the largest segmented doc (Kendojidai 2014, ~23,529 segs).

---

## 6. Prioritisation

### P0 — Critical path (must pass for launch)

| Flow ID | Name | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `RF-TRANS-01` | Login → edit → save → advance phase | Core TEP workflow |
| `RF-READER-01` | Browse → open → read → bookmark → resume | Primary user-facing flow |
| `RF-ADMIN-01` | Dashboard review (all widgets) | Admin monitoring |
| `RF-ANON-01` | Landing → register → login | Onboarding funnel |
| `RF-CROSS-01` | Cold-start latency baseline | Production reliability |

### P1 — High priority (strongly recommended)

| Flow ID | Name |
|---------|------|
| `RF-READER-02` | Theme switch cycle (all 7 themes) |
| `RF-READER-03` | ZH toggle + PDF view |
| `RF-TRANS-02` | Agent suggestion → accept (EditPatternModal) |
| `RF-TRANS-05` | Context Builder two-stage MAC-RAG |
| `RF-TRANS-06` | Comment thread |
| `RF-ADMIN-02` | User role change |
| `RF-ADMIN-04` | Assignment management |
| `RF-CROSS-02` | Large-book performance |
| `RF-CROSS-03` | Global theme persistence |
| `RF-CROSS-04` | Error / empty states |

### P2 — Nice to have

| Flow ID | Name |
|---------|------|
| `RF-READER-04` | Full-text search with context |
| `RF-READER-05` | Status filter sidebar |
| `RF-TRANS-03` | StyleRuleModal on edited phase |
| `RF-TRANS-04` | MemoryWriteBanner |
| `RF-TRANS-07` | QA issue resolve |
| `RF-TRANS-08` | Batch advance |
| `RF-TRANS-09` | Filter bar (status + text + myPhase) |
| `RF-TRANS-10` | Keyboard shortcuts |
| `RF-TRANS-11` | Mobile editor phone-block |
| `RF-ADMIN-03` | Publish policy toggle |
| `RF-ADMIN-05` | Per-user assignments |
| `RF-ADMIN-06` | Segmentize |
| `RF-ANON-02` | 401 gate |
| `RF-CROSS-05` | EN/ZH language switcher |

### Recommended first 3–5 flows to instrument

1. **`RF-TRANS-01`** (Login → edit → save → advance phase) — Exercises auth, editor hydration, segment CRUD, phase transition, and history. Single-flow coverage of the core value proposition.
2. **`RF-READER-01`** (Browse → open → read → bookmark → resume) — Exercises document list sorting, reader rendering, bookmarking, and progress persistence. Covers reader features end-to-end.
3. **`RF-ADMIN-01`** (Dashboard review) — Exercises the most timing-sensitive page (cold-start analytics). Validates skeleton→content transition, stat card hydration, all widget sections.
4. **`RF-READER-02`** (Theme switch cycle) — Highest-density UX/readability check: 7 themes, font size range, font color picker, layout widths. Finds contrast regressions quickly.
5. **`RF-CROSS-01`** (Cold-start baseline) — Establishes timing budgets for all other flows. Failure here indicates infra issues, not app bugs.

## 7. Pass/Fail & UX-Grading Rubric

### 7.1 Time budgets per step type

| Step type | Warm (ms) | Cold (s) | Hard timeout (s) | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Page navigation (static) | < 2,000 | < 8 | 30 | `/login`, `/` landing |
| Page navigation (SSR + auth) | < 3,000 | < 15 | 30 | `/documents`, reader, editor (small doc) |
| Page navigation (analytics) | < 5,000 | < 60 | 75 | `/admin` dashboard |
| Editor segment activation | < 500 | < 2,000 | 10 | Click segment → editor visible |
| Save (Ctrl+S) | < 1,000 | < 3,000 | 10 | Text save → API → confirmation |
| Phase advance | < 2,000 | < 5,000 | 15 | Confirm → API → badge update |
| Agent suggestion generation | — | < 30,000 | 60 | LLM call; variable |
| MAC-RAG compose | — | < 10,000 | 30 | API call |
| MAC-RAG generate | — | < 30,000 | 60 | LLM call |
| Theme switch (reader) | < 300 | < 1,000 | 5 | CSS variable swap; should be instant |
| Filter apply (small doc) | < 100 | < 500 | 5 | Client-side array filter |
| Filter apply (large doc) | < 2,000 | < 5,000 | 15 | Client-side on 23k items |
| Reader page turn | < 1,000 | < 3,000 | 10 | Page navigation |
| Search sidebar debounce | < 300 | < 1,000 | 5 | After last keystroke |

**Grading**:
- **PASS**: Within warm budget.
- **WARN**: Between warm and cold budget, but under hard timeout.
- **FAIL**: Exceeds hard timeout.

### 7.2 Readability / UX severity scale

| Severity | Criteria | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **BLOCKING** | Content unreadable (contrast < 2.5:1); page crashes; blank white screen; action fails silently with no feedback | White text on white background; `text-gray-100` on `bg-white` |
| **MAJOR** | WCAG AA failure (contrast 2.5–4.5:1 for body text); skeleton visible > 10s; layout shift > 0.2 CLS; touch target < 24px on mobile | `text-gray-400` on `bg-white` before N1 fix (gray-on-white); page jumps 200px during hydration |
| **MINOR** | WCAG AA bare pass but subjectively hard to read; skeleton flash < 2s; minor overflow on narrow viewport; focus indicator missing | `text-gray-500` on `bg-white` (passes 4.5:1 but feels washed out); horizontal scrollbar on tablet for admin table |

**Check**: Every flow in Section 3 must have at least one BLOCKING check (contrast audit on primary content area) and one MAJOR check (skeleton→content transition).

### 7.3 Flow-level verdict

- **PASS**: All steps pass timing + UX. 0 BLOCKING, 0 MAJOR issues.
- **PASS WITH OBSERVATIONS**: All steps pass timing. ≤ 2 MINOR issues documented.
- **WARN**: 1 MAJOR issue or ≥ 3 MINOR issues. Flow still completes.
- **FAIL**: Any BLOCKING issue, or any step exceeds hard timeout.

---

## 8. Assumptions & Gaps

### 8.1 Selector assumptions

The following testids/selectors are **not confirmed** in the current codebase and are assumed based on component patterns:

| Assumed selector | Component / area | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Reader view-mode buttons (Bilingual, Aligned, etc.) | `ReaderView.tsx` | `MODE_LABELS` constant; assume buttons have `aria-pressed` or text content |
| Reader bookmark button | Reader toolbar | No `data-testid` found for bookmark toggle; assume icon button with bookmark-related aria-label |
| Reader pagination controls | Reader footer | Assumed "Next" / "Previous" buttons or page number links |
| Reader theme buttons (Dark, Solarized, etc.) | `ReaderSettingsPanel.tsx` | Theme buttons currently use color swatch buttons without `data-testid`; assume `aria-label` or text |
| Font selector (sans/serif/mincho) | `ReaderSettingsPanel.tsx` | Assumed radio/button group with font family labels |
| Register page form | `/register` page | Assume similar structure to `/login` (email + password inputs) |

### 8.2 Known gaps

1. **Reader theme/SiteNav interaction** (RF-CROSS-03 Step 6): The reader has its own 7-theme system. The global SiteNav gear sets a separate theme. The interaction between these two theme systems (does global dark mode override reader-selected light theme? Does reader setting survive navigation to non-reader pages?) needs **manual verification** before the instrumented test can assert behavior.

2. **Agent suggestion availability**: Flows RF-TRANS-02 and RF-TRANS-03 assume the agent suggestion feature is available and functional. If the backend LLM integration is down or rate-limited, these flows will fail for infra reasons, not code reasons. The test should detect this and skip (not fail) gracefully.

3. **WebSocket realtime subscriptions**: The editor uses `usePresence` which opens a Supabase Realtime WebSocket. This connection is persistent and never closes, so `networkidle` waits will hang. All content-visible waits must use explicit element selectors — this is already documented in Section 5.1.

4. **Vercel Hobby cold-start variability**: Cold-start times on Vercel Hobby (free tier) are highly variable. The 3-attempt retry with 2s delay may not be sufficient in all cases. Consider 5-attempt for `/admin` analytics.

5. **Document availability**: Some flows assume the existence of a document with ZH segments and a paired PDF. If the production DB changes (e.g., all ZH segments removed), those flows will skip. The test runner should log skips distinctly from failures.

6. **No `data-testid` on reader view-mode controls, bookmark button, theme buttons**: These are critical for user-flow testing. Recommendation: add testids during the downstream instrumentation phase before writing Playwright code.

---

## 9. Downstream Implementation Notes

When instrumented Playwright tests are written from this plan:

- Use `test.describe` grouping by flow ID (e.g., `RF-READER-01`).
- Use `test.step` for each numbered step with embedded `performance.now()` timing.
- Tag top-level describes with `@user-flow` and priority (`@p0`, `@p1`, `@p2`).
- Use shared `beforeAll` auth (Supabase REST token + cookie injection) to avoid per-flow login cost.
- Small-doc selection: sort by `segment_count` ascending, pick first with `segment_count > 0`.
- Screenshot naming: `[flow-id]/[step-number]-[label].png`.
- Contrast checking: extract `getComputedStyle` color + backgroundColor, compute WCAG relative luminance.
- Never use `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`.

---

**Total flows**: 27 flows across 4 personas + 5 cross-cutting.
- Reader: 5 flows
- Translator: 11 flows
- Admin: 6 flows
- Anonymous: 2 flows
- Cross-cutting: 5 flows (cold-start, large-book, theme persistence, error states, lang switcher)

**Ready for review**. Instrumented Playwright implementation to follow in a subsequent phase.
